WRITE AN ALGORITHM FOR ACCEPTING TWO NUMBERS, DIVIDING THE FIRST NUMBER BY SECOND AND DISPLAY THEIR QUOTIENT





STEP1: Start
STEP2: Assume that a,b and c are three variables
STEP3: accept the user's first input a
STEP4: accept the user's second input b
STEP5: To get c, divide a By b (c=a/b)
STEP6: print c
STEP7: Stop
